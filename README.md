# Week 19
## Plan
- Create a game similar to in week 10 but using tkinter and a greater knowlege of python
## Work Done
- Create a 3 Room Game with some simple features:
  - Player inventory
  - Config file to easily change the layout of the game
## What I learnt
- Data driven programming is longer in the short term but in the long term can make it a lot easier to expand the program in this case a game
